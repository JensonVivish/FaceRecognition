# 🧠 Face Recognition & Tracking System

Welcome to our Face Recognition Project — a real-time computer vision application built using Python, OpenCV, face_recognition, and Deep SORT (because one tracker is never enough). 😎

This README will walk you through the whole process — from encoding faces to running the system like a pro (or at least pretending to be one).

## ⚙️ What It Does

- Encodes known faces from a folder (`known_faces/`)
- Detects and recognizes faces from live webcam feed
- Tracks them using Deep SORT (so the system doesn't get confused when people move around)
- Draws a box around each face, labels them, and shows live FPS
- Absolutely does *not* call the FBI... unless you add that part 😉
